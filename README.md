# Kröhnkite

A dynamic tiling extension for KWin 6 only.

Kröhnkite is mainly inspired by [dwm][] from suckless folks, and aims to
provide rock solid stability while fully integrating into KWin.

The name of the script is from mineral [Kröhnkite][wikipedia]; it starts with
K and looks cool.

## Features

- DWM-like window tiling
  - Dynamically tile windows, rather than manually placing each.
  - Floating windows
- Fully integrates into KWin features, including:
  - **Multi-screen**
  - **Activities & Virtual desktop**
  - Basic window management (minimize, fullscreen, switching, etc)
- Multiple Layout Support
  - Tiling layout
  - Monocle layout
  - Desktop-friendly layouts (Spread, Stair)

## Development Requirement

- Typescript (tested w/ 3.1.x)
- GNU Make
- p7zip (7z)

## Look at me

1. Delete unused KWin shortcuts:

```
qdbus6 org.kde.kglobalaccel /component/kwin org.kde.kglobalaccel.Component.cleanUp
```

2. If you have a gap or vice versa you have gray(white etc) rectangle that means that there is a program with size 1x1 that have to be filtered by title or other ways. Make sure that the following programs, if you have them, have been added to the filter:

```
xwaylandvideobridge,plasmashell,ksplashqml
```

## Installation

You can install Kröhnkite in multiple ways.

### Using .kwinscript package file

You can download `krohnkite-x.x.x.x.kwinscript` file, and install it through
_System Settings_.

1.  Download the kwinscript file
2.  Open `System Settings` > `Window Management` > `KWin Scripts`
3.  Press `Import KWin script...` on the top-right corner
4.  Select the downloaded file

Alternatively, through command-line:
get info about package:

```
kpackagetool6 -t KWin/Script -s krohnkite
```

install:

```
kpackagetool6 -t KWin/Script -i krohnkite-x.x.x.x.kwinscript
```

upgrade:

```
kpackagetool6 -t KWin/Script -u krohnkite-x.x.x.x.kwinscript
```

uninstall:

```
kpackagetool6 -t KWin/Script -r krohnkite
```

### Installing from Git repository

Make sure you have [go-task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/), [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) packages installed. All packages after building will be in `builds` folder.
The simplest method to automatically build and install kwinscript package would be:

```
 go-task install
```

You can also build `.kwinscript` package file using:

```
go-task package
```

uninstall package:

```
go-task uninstall
```

## Settings

### Add a class name, a resource name or a window caption to ignore or float

1. to found window's className,resourcename or caption see [readme](https://github.com/anametologin/krohnkite#search-a-window-parameters-to-filter-float-etc)
2. you can use the name of class in square brackets: `[myNamE]` will float or ignore all windows with class or resource names such: 'myname1', 'Myname2', 'Notmyname555' etc...

### Choose layout for screen by default

1. Open Krohnkite options: ![options](img/conf.png)
2. Tab `Rules->Screen default layout`. Layout configuration has format `OutputName:ActivityId:VirtualDesktopName:layoutName` multi monitor example: `HDMI-A-1:99a12h44-e9a6-1142-55eedaa7-3a922a15ab08::columns,DP-2:spread,DP-3:Desktop 3:tile,:threecolumn` - result will be:

- set `columns` layout as default on monitor `HDMI-A-1`, only on activity with id:`99a12h44-e9a6-1142-55eedaa7-3a922a15ab08`, every Virtual Desktops on this activity.(if you specify `activity id` you have to to specify virtual desktop name or leave it blank)
- set `spreadlayout` layout as default on monitor `DP-2`, every Activities, every Virtual Desktops;
- set `tilelayout` layout as default on monitor `DP-3`, on every activity, only on virtual desktop with name `Desktop 3`
- set `threecolumnlayout` layout as default on all monitors,all activities and all Virtual Desktops not covered by the previous rules

2. How to find `outputName`, `activityId`, `VirtualDesktopName`, `layoutName`:
   Right after system boot run KSystemLog

- Push ignore button
- Type in filter string: `krohnkite`
- Right after `KROHNKITE: starting the script` string you will see one if you have one monitor or multiple lines: Screen(output):`Screen Name`,Desktop(name):`Virtual Desktop Name`,Activity:`Activity Id`,layouts: `numbered layouts` (the case doesn't matter,`layout` ending can be omitted): `tilelayout`, `monoclelayout`, `columns`, `threecolumnlayout,` `spreadlayout`, `stairlayout`, `spirallayout`, `stackedlayout`, `floatinglayout`, `btreelayout`

3. `Apply` -> `reboot`

### Search a window parameters to filter, float etc.

1. Krohnkite options: ![options](img/conf.png)
2. Options->Debug new Windows
3. Reboot
4. Run KSystemLog
5. Push `Ignore` button
6. Type in filter string: `krohnkite`
7. All created windows krohnkite working with will be there.
8. Every debug entry contains parameters except those that are false and empty.

## Tips

### Setting Up for Multi-Screen

Krohnkite supports multi-screen setup, but KWin has to be configured to unlock
the full potential of the script.

1. Enable `Separate Screen Focus` feature:

- `System Settings` > `Window Management` > `Window Behavior` > `Multiscreen Behaviour`

  `OR` use console commands:

```
   kwriteconfig6 --file ~/.config/kwinrc --group Windows --key ActiveMouseScreen false
   kwriteconfig6 --file ~/.config/kwinrc --group Windows --key SeparateScreenFocus true
```

2. Bind keys for global shortcut `Switch to Next/Previous Screen`
   (Recommend: `Meta + ,` / `Meta + .`)
3. Bind keys for global shortcut `Window to Next/Previous Screen`
   (Recommend: `Meta + <` / `Meta + >`)

### Removing Title Bars

Breeze window decoration can be configured to completely remove title bars from
all windows:

1. `System Setting` > `Application Style` > `Window Decorations`
2. Click `Configure Breeze` inside the decoration preview.
3. `Window-Specific Overrides` tab > `Add` button
4. Enter the followings, and press `Ok`:
   - `Regular expression to match`: `.*`
   - Tick `Hide window title bar`

### Changing Border Colors

Changing the border color makes it easier to identify current window. This is
convinient if title bars are removed.

1. You can use the Oxygen decoration theme. [Oxygen theme settings][]
1. You can install third-party decorations, see [Border color conversation][]

[Border color conversation]: https://github.com/anametologin/krohnkite/issues/15

### Setting Minimum Geometry Size

Some applications like discord and KDE settings dont tile nicely as they have a minimum size requirement.
This causes the applications to overlap with other applications. To mitigate this we can set minimum size for all windows to be 0.

1. `System Setting` > `Window Management` > `Window Rules`
2. Click on `+ Add New...`
3. Set `Window class` to be `Unimportant`
4. Set `Window types` to `Normal Window`
5. Click `+ Add Properties...`
6. Add the `Minimum Size` Property
7. Set the fields to `Force` and `0` x `0`
8. Apply

### Prevent borders and shadows from disappearing.

When a window is marked "maximized" in Breeze theme, its borders are removed to save screen space.
This behavior may not be preferable depending on your setup. This can be mitigated by disabling maximized windows using Window Rules.

1. `System Setting` > `Window Management` > `Window Rules`
2. Click on `+ Add New...`
3. Set `Window class` to be `Unimportant`
4. Set `Window types` to `Normal Window`
5. Click `+ Add Properties...`
6. Add the `Maximized horizontally` and `Maximized vertically` Properties.
7. Set the options to `Force` and `No`.
8. Apply
